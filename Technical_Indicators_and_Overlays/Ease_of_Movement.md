## Introduction
* Developed by Richard Arms, Ease of Movement (EMV) is a volume-based oscillator that fluctuates above and below the zero line. As its name implies, it is designed to measure the “ease” of price movement. Arms created Equivolume charts to visually display price ranges and volume. Ease of Movement takes Equivolume to the next level by quantifying the price/volume relationship and showing the results as an oscillator. In general, prices are advancing with relative ease when the oscillator is in positive territory. Conversely, prices are declining with relative ease when the oscillator is in negative territory.

* 由理查德武器，运动的方便(EMV)是一个体积为基础的振荡器，波动在零线以上和之下。顾名思义，它的设计是为了衡量价格变动的“舒适度”。军火创造了等量图表，以直观地显示价格范围和数量。通过量化价格/成交量的关系，并将结果显示为一个振荡器，易移动将等量提升到下一个水平。一般来说，当振子处于正向区域时，价格相对容易上涨。相反，当振荡器处于负区间时，价格相对容易下降。
